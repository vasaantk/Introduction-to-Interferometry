# Introduction to Interferometry

Want to learn about Radio Interferometry?!

Here are my notes aimed at beginners to explain how radio interferometry works. Lecture.pdf will guide you through the main ideas that lead to a working radio interferometry as an end product. My aim has been to proide the learner with a foundation upon which they can use to move to more advanced studies.
